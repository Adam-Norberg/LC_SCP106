    SCP-106, also known as ''The Old Man'', is an
    entity of unknown origin that constantly secretes a corrosive substance onto
    anything it comes in contact with. It has been classified as level ''Keter''
    by a previous and separate research organisation. The documents describing the
    characteristics of SCP-106 indicate that it poses a serious threat to any and
    all who find themselves near it''s vicinity.


    These and other similar documents
    from the aforementioned organisation were found left inside a ship that returned
    without its crew on its deadline. Severe levels of corrosion were found scattered
    around the inside of the ship which had fused some of these documents to the
    ground. The reinforced blast doors showed the highest signs of deterioration.
    Forensic samples among these spots of corrosion showed signs of organic matter
    that matched those from the vessel''s missing crew.


    After a thorough investigation
    using simulations based on the documents found inside, it is thought that the
    entity SCP-106 got inside the ship through the doors while they were closed,
    mere moments after the ship has started to departure.


    The Company advice
    all employees to exercise extreme caution and to immediately evacuate if ''The
    Old Man'' is spotted. Going alone is strictly forbidden.'
