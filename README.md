# Lethal Company SCP-106 Enemy

## TODO
### Scripts:
- Add puddles of corrosion on occasion, giving players who walk into it a debuff (maybe also alerts SCP-106 of their location?)
    - "drunkness"?
- Can't jump, so if on another level try to "re-appear" through wall near current targetPlayer (Hunted Player)
- Special Kill Animations: (All Kills are 1-hit, player can be saved if SCP-106 is stunned during animation)
    - From behind: Hands appear in front of the player's camera / Neck twisted
    - From front: Grabs and spews corrosion onto the player's face

### Models:


### Sounds:
